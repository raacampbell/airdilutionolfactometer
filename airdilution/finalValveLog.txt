We now set about the plans for the final valve. 
We will try setting it after the 100 ml split so that we are gating
small quantities of odour. 

First we pipe about 4.5 SLPM of air to the wind detector and add 1 sec
pulses of varying wind speeds from a 3-way valve. 

out=valveTransient(AC)
save valveTransient1 out
analyseValveTransient(out)

So there's a noticeable dip in the windspeed even at 0.05. 



I'll now pass it through a second controller to go down to about 1,000
ml/min. Using a short green needle to vent the rest of the gas. Even
the pink create too much pressure and lead to artefacts.

OK. Nice. That actually looks better (not saved). Next I will try
adding a pair if valves and flipping them in antiphase to see if we
can get rid of the transient completely.


save valveTransient2 out
Wow! There's basically no transient at all now. I like!

----------------

Ok. Now I need to check that the odour flow injection at the 5 SLPM
dilution is indeed linear and reasonable. 

So I inject different flows into ~ 5 SLPM using the alicat. There are
2 3-way valves (one for odour and one for clean air) for the final
valve. We are injecting through the clean air 3-way via the alicat.

bigDilution1:
analyseEthanol(out)

It looks linear to me and it goes through zero. 


Now I will try to work out how large the signal is through the tap. 
save bigDilution2 out

In principle, this looks good. 

Now I will try to equalise 100 ml through the alicat clean air with
the 100 ml through the tap.
