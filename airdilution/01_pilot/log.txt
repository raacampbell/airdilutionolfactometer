We are going to try to do small air dilutions using the old-fashioned
tubing .

1/16 " ID tubing.

data_1

MFC D at a range of different flows. 

Next we plumb in MFC C with a T and will first re-calibrate D. 

data_2:
looks very similar. 


data_3
Set MFC D to 1 l/min and inject progressively larger flows into the
tube via the side arm of a T. Now this looks wondefully linear at 0 to
500 ml/min injection flow. 

Let's focus into the very low flow range:
data_4
Looks really quite nice at 0:0.002:0.1 
I'll run it again with a longer acq period so that I can get a
smoother curve: data_5

data_6
How reproducible is a 0.01 injection?
The 0.01 is substantially higher than the 0. So I think we're good
with the 1:100 dilution. 


data_7
Now what does the 1 ml injection look like?
Now we put 5 to 10 ml of water in the bottom of the vial and attach a
tube going through it. Measure again. We appear to get a nice signal
but it's smaller than when we don't have the water. 

So I'll generate a calibration curve for vial and water+vial. Then I
can compare those to the T piece. 

data_8: even through the tube in the water, the signal is linear. Now
we do it out of the water and we can compare the slopes. 
data_9: With the tube going through the water in tube removed. 
The fits are basically identitcal. 

data_10:
I shall do it again but this time I will place teflon tape around the
needle, so that the fit is tight onto the teflon tube. 


data_11 Right. Now the PID detects the odour.  This looks pretty nice,
although the lower flow rates do take WAY long to peak. I'll run it
again but present for longer and only go up to about 5 ml/min

data_12
This is looking nice. 


_______________________________________________________________
I bet we'll be able to do the 1:1000 using air. So now I will check
what is the PID response to:
pure water
1:1000 eth/water
1:100 eth/water
1:10 eth/water
stock ethanol

I will do this using:
250 ml/min carrier comparied to 250 ml/min through the odour vial and
1 ml/min through the carrier. 

1. waterVial.mat
dissapointingly, there's a fairly large response when we go through
the water vial. The PID flow rate is set to low and the gain at x1. 

etho_1in1000
Bigger signal. We have some odour backing up towards the clean air MFC

etho_1in100

etho_1in10

etho_pure
Have corrected the backing up by flushing the clean air line before
acquiring data. 

So now we can try air dilutions up to 1:100 using the pure ethanol
with a total flow rate at 250 ml/min. Although at 0.0025 I don't see
many bubbles...


eth_airdilution 

Right, now we can compare these things:
compareLiquidAir.m
The air dilutions (black stars) are lower than the comparable liquid
dilutions (at least for this 0.25 l/min flow). But this 1/4 of the
flow that we'd normally use for the air.

Bottom line is that it's possible to do really tiny air dilutions with
this tubing set up
