
N-Research valve is set up. Clean air in NO port and stock ethoh in
neighbouring port. We do a range of carrier flows at a range of
concentrations:

flowMatrix1
flowMatrix2

Ok, so it looks linear at first and then it decelatetes. 
flowMatrix_anem_1

Try a wider range of different flows:
flowMatrix_anem_2


This is odd:
a. The flow during the odour is higher than the flow before the
odour. 
b. The flow rate can take a long time to equilibrate. 
c. The baseline flows are variable. 

Shit. 

I'll start by pumping a range of different flow combinations through
air vial to see what happens.

flowMatrix_cleanOnly_1


It seems that the flow rate through the carrier path is lower than the
rate from a vial. Hmph. 

Ok, there were two problems:
1. The flow out of MFC D (carrier) was low because the tube coming
from that MFC was not secure. It was only deliverying 0.7 l/min. 
2. The odour path was also low and working strangely because there was
leakage in the line. 

So everything is now working well. I'll record the flow matrix again. 
This recording has air going through only the clean air vial and the
carrier. We try a range of different ratios of clean air and
carrier. The should all have the same flow. That's good. 

flowMatrix_cleanOnly_2
Now I want to try injecting progressively larger absolute quantities
of air through the air vial into the carrier:

flowMatrix_cleanOnly_3
Awesome. Very linear. With different slopes. Try a few more carrier
flows. 
flowMatrix_cleanOnly_4

Now we can try odour again! (Ignore the "cleanOnly"!)

flowMatrix_cleanOnly_5

Bollocks. Somehow we developed a bad reflux into the tube above the
odour valves. Presumbably the NR valves were open with not enough
positive pressure going into the valve. I bet it was the really low
odour concentrations I was trying. 

I have left it over-night but I think there is still some odour in the
clean air part of the system. Although air bubbles through odour at
0.025 and 0.01, I'm not seeing a response. 

flowMatrix_cleanOnly_6

I don't think anything is left in the system, but I can't pick up
flows <= 0.025. I will try not bubbling...


flowMatrix_noBubble_1
I tried not bubbling. If the flow rate is too great, we see nasty
kinetics. But Still no 0.01 dilution. I think this one is backing up. 

flowMatrix_bubble_1
This looks way better.

Now let's try adding some glass beads

flowMatrix_bubbleBeads_1
10 ml of odour and the rest is beads. So beads are half way up the
vial. 

Now we put glass beads into the 1:100 dilution and measure that. 
flowMatrix_bubbleBeads_1in100
This looks way worse. Really not as nice.
