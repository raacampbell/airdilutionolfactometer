The system is mostly set up and we have a load of new Alicat MFCs. 

I think I've set up all the flows correctly but I'm stuck because the
second odour dilution is giving me only about 1:50 not 1:100. 

flowMatrix_bubbleBeads_1
10 ml of odour and the rest is beads. So beads are half way up the
vial. 

Now we put glass beads into the 1:100 dilution and measure that. 
flowMatrix_bubbleBeads_1in100
This looks way worse. Really not as nice.

The system is mostly set up and we have a load of new Alicat MFCs. 

I think I've set up all the flows correctly but I'm stuck because the
second odour dilution is giving me only about 1:50 not 1:100. 
see: dilutionCompare_100615.mat

So I will check all the flows and then call Alicat and Aurora to as
for help. 

flipValve(11,1) %allow air through air vial
setFlow(AC,0.5,'AB') %1 LPM total flow. 
%Record flow data for 10 seconds at output of odour vials. 
output=pollFM(AC,'G',0.2,5*10);
hist([output.volumetricFlow])
mean is 1.02. So that's fine. 

Now we measure flow after the first suction point. 
It's exhibiting some weird things but the mean is 0.08 (needle1)
This is saw-toothing. 

Now we measure at the end of the second needle valve point but with
the flow set up as before (with 1 LPM going into the first needle
valve). The mean of needle2a is 0.98 LPM. 

Now I will close the tap feeding olfactometer air to the second needle
valve and run again. Argh, it also saw-tooths: needle2b

Now I'll remove the second needle valve and see how the 5 LPM air flow
responds with the ~70 ml/min injected into it. 

needle2c: So this is measuring the output straight from the Aalborg
5SLPM. Stable

Now open the valve adding flow from the first needle valve and see what we add:
needle2d

It appears to be adding only about 20 ml, which isn't right

save test1 needle* output

One last thing. Does the oscilation go away if the MFC doesn't go via
the olfactimeter? Yes, it still happens: direct.mat. It changes by
about 10 ml/min

Let's do some more checks. 
Ok, now I set B to loop pressure and see the flow through the first
needle valve: directPressureLoop2.mat It's stationary. 
directPressureLoop2.mat

Now:
MFCB -> needle
     -> FM
Signal at FM is not stationary: directPressureLoop_3.mat
It's saw-toothing and, what's more, it's doing it in discrete steps. 

directPressureLoop_4 is as _3 but we're measuring the parameters of
the MFC not the FM. Yes, I see it there too. The pressure in both 3
and 4 are good (static).


Ok. I set the first needle valve to 0.044 (mean, it saw-tooths). When
I inject this into either 1 SLPM or 4.9 SLPM I see an increased flow
of 39 - 40 LPM. Good! 

Now do the second odour dilution. 

***
Saw tooths seem to come from pressure build-ups. When the system is
connected to a flow meter I see volume and mass flow oscilations in
the flow meter and in the mass flow of the MFC. I don't see them in
the volumetric flow. If I disconnect the meter, the fluctuations in
the mass flow go away. 

oscilationExplanation.mat

I have checked the flows (above) and as far as I can tell, they add up
as they should. So I really am injecting 50ml in to 5000ml. I will now
record (AGAIN!) with the PID. First at the output of the odour
delivery system where flow is at 1 LPM, and again at the output of the
whole system where I should be getting 1/100 of that value. 

diltutionTest.mat

Righto. Now we need to confirms that we really did add 50 ml to 5 L. 
I'm pretty sure that I'm producing about 42-53 ml from the first
needle valve. So I'll measure flow rate at the second with the tap
open and closed.

secondDirect - Connect 5SLPM meter to 5LPM flow controller to see how
much flow we get. It seems pretty stable at 5.57 (don't know why it's
not 5, that's where the controller is (4.9). 

secondNeedle - Connect 5SLPM meter to needle valve and 5LPM flow
controller. So now we're seeing what flow rates we'd see without
adding the odour dilution. This will oscilate. 

Now we add in the odour:
secondNeedlePlusOlf 

I think I'm getting about 24 ml/min of extra flow here. 
save diltutionCheck_1706 secondDirect secondNeedle secondNeedlePlusOlf


That's a dilution of about 1.14/0.096
