<p>
The system is mostly set up and we have a load of new Alicat MFCs. 
</p>

<p>
I think I've set up all the flows correctly but I'm stuck because the
second odour dilution is giving me only about 1:14 not 1:100. 
see: <b>dilutionCompare_100615.mat</b>
</p>

<b>flowMatrix_bubbleBeads_1.mat</b>
10 ml of odour and the rest is beads. So beads are half way up the
vial. 
</p>

<p>
Now we put glass beads into the 1:100 dilution and measure that. 
<b>flowMatrix_bubbleBeads_1in100.mat</b>
This looks way worse. Really not as nice.

Let's measure the flows in the system to check that we're seeing what
we think we're seeing. 
<pre>
flipValve(11,1) %allow air through air vial
setFlow(AC,0.5,'AB') %1 LPM total flow. 
%Record flow data for 10 seconds at output of odour vials. 
output=pollFM(AC,'G',0.2,5*10);
hist([output.volumetricFlow])
mean is 1.02. So that's fine. 
</pre>

<p>
<b>needle1</b>
Now we measure flow after the first suction point. 
Oh dear. The flow is oscilating in a saw-tooth manner. 
</p>
<img src="needle1.png" />

<table width=900px border=1px>
<tr>
<td>
<p>
<b>needle2a</b>
Now we measure at the end of the second needle valve point but with
the flow set up as before (with 1 LPM going into the first needle
valve). 
</p>
<img src="needle2a.png" />
</td>

<td>
<p>
<b>needle2b</b>
Now I will close the tap feeding olfactometer air to the second needle
valve and run again. Argh, it also saw-tooths:
</p>
<img src="needle2b.png" />
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<p>Now I'll remove the second needle valve and see how the 5 LPM air flow
responds with the ~70 ml/min injected into it.  <b>needle2c</b>: So this is measuring the output straight from the Aalborg
5 SLPM. Stable</p>
<img src="needle2c.png" />
</td>

<td>
Now open the valve adding flow from the first needle valve and see what we add:
needle2d

It appears to be adding only about 20 ml, which isn't right

</td>
</tr>
</table>


<i>save test1 needle* output</i>

<p>
Does the oscilation go away if the MFC doesn't go via
the olfactometer? No, it still happens: <b>direct.mat</b>. It changes by
about 10 ml/min
</p>
<img src="direct.png" />

<p>
Let's do some more checks. 
Ok, now I set B to loop pressure and see the flow through the first
needle valve.  It's fairly stationary. <b>directPressureLoop2.mat</b>
</p>


<p>
Now it's time to add a needle valve to vacuum and see how the
measurement goes at the other side of the Y:
</p>
<pre>

           -> needle
          /
MFC B ----
	  \
           -> Flow Meter
</pre>
<p>
The signal at the FM is not
stationary: <b>directPressureLoop_3.mat</b>. 
It's saw-toothing. It appears to be doing it in discrete steps but
when we put the analogue signal on the scope it becomes obvious that
we're just looking at rounding artefacts. 
</p>
<img src="directPressureLoop_3.png" />


<p>
Ok. I set the first needle valve to about 0.044 (mean, it
saw-tooths). When I inject this into either 1 SLPM or 4.9 SLPM I see
an increased flow of 39 - 40 LPM. Good!

<p>
Talked to Neil at Alicat. He had me change the P, D, and I parameters
on the MFC (it was B) but the effect still occured. It turned out that
the saw tooths come from pressure build-ups that occur when the system
is connected to a flow meter. I see volume and mass flow oscilations in
the flow meter  <i>and in themass flow of the MFC</i>. I don't see them in
the volumetric flow of the MFC. If I disconnect the meter, the fluctuations in
the mass flow go away: <b>oscilationExplanation.mat</b>

I have checked the flows (above) and as far as I can tell, they add up
as they should. So I really am injecting 50ml in to 5000ml. I will now
record (AGAIN!) with the PID. First at the output of the odour
delivery system where flow is at 1 LPM, and again at the output of the
whole system where I should be getting 1/100 of that value. 
</p>
<b>diltutionTest.mat</b>

<p>
Righto. Now we need to confirm that we really did add 50 ml to 5 L. 
I'm pretty sure that I'm producing about 42-53 ml from the first
needle valve. So I'll measure flow rate at the second with the tap
open and closed.

<table width=900px border=1px>
<tr>
<td>
<p>
secondDirect - Connect 5SLPM meter to 5LPM flow controller to see how
much flow we get. It seems pretty stable at 5.57 (don't know why it's
not 5, that's where the controller is (4.9). 
<img src="secondDirect.png" />
</td>

<td
<p>
<b>secondNeedle</b> - Connect 5SLPM meter to needle valve and 5LPM flow
controller. So now we're seeing what flow rates we'd see without
adding the odour dilution. This will oscilate. Now we add in the odour:
<b>secondNeedlePlusOlf</b>
<img src="secondNeedle.png" />
I think I'm getting about 24 ml/min of extra flow here. Ok... So this
is sort of what we want. Don't forget that the second needle valve is
carrying away a steady 4950. If we add 50 ml/min then it's not the
case that 40 ml of this goes to vacuum and 10 ml goes to the fly. All
extra 50 ml go to the fly.

<p>
So what does the PID response look like? Wow, just like the one I
recorded earlier! It's 1:14. <i>Oh no it's not! See below..</i>

<h3>21/06/2010</h3>
I have (finally) realised two things:
<ol>
<li>I need to remember that the needle valves are
subtractions not divisions. So if 5 LPM is going in and 4 is going to
vac then I get 1. But if I inject an extra 50 ml then all the extra 50
ml will go to me. It won't be divided 4/5 to vac and 1/5 to me (as the
odour dilution is). </li>

<li>
Second good thing: the fat in-line valves allow me to try a range of
different odour dilutions. The resulting calibration curve is
non-linear and I can easily measure it. 
</li>
</ol>

<p>
A concentration series from 0.5 lpm to 9 ml/min out of the vials looks
like this:
</p>
<img src="calibration_0621.png" />
See dilutionsGood and calibrations2106

<p> 
Since we can push low flow rates through the vials we will record the
signal out of the vials (where flow is 1 lpm) at flows of about 5
ml/min (0.005). We will then present 0.5, 100 times this, and record
after the second air dilution (which reduces concentration by a factor
of 100). The magnitudes of the two signals should be similar. 
</p>

<p>
At the second dilution point we record 0.5 as being ~0.36 V. At the
first dilution we record 0.005 as being about 0.2V, so the signal at
the second dilution seems somewhat strong. It corresponds to 10ml not
5 ml. Nevertheless, it's close and I'm pretty sure we can make it the
same if the dilutions are done more carefully. Having a better second
needle valve would be a high priority.
