How does the system work in practice?

Is a recording of what you see when it's been inactive for about 24
hours. Benzaldehyde is weak the first time then becomes
consistent. There is also the high background that takes about 3 reps
to go away. 

Ok...

So now we record again with about a 10-20 minute gap between this
presentation and the last one. This one looks cleaner but there is a
hint of high-baseline crap seeping in there. 

Try evacuating the upper ring for 10 seconds before starting to
present odours.

Ok... The baseline issue is better but there is weird non-stationarity
in the odour responses. Probably because in this run I'm presenting
them more often since there are only 3 odours. 

Nope. Actually. Looks nice at 3 odours so long as we vent for 30
seconds then present 20 seconds of each odour
(params_090903191309.mat). The weird drifting offset is still there,
however. Don't understand. Could it be PID-related?

Ahhh no. When you're not presenting anything and all valves are shut
you get loads of diffusion and a detectable odour...
