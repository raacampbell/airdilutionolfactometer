I'll just do some MCH...
Set PID to x1 and suction to low
Set flow through the vial to 500 ml/min and stick it into #27 with the
old (crappy) check valve and bubble. The MCH was freshly made today.

Sod. The gain had to be at x10, because that's what we used for
e-room. Do it again...

This is too low and we're getting a valve switching artefact

TOMORROW:
> Clean PID again. 
Ok. cleaned with line from the wall. Dropped the bulb, but it's not
cracked and the PID lit up straight away. Test with ethanol from 4 of
vials. 6 reps each. Bubbling through each. Odour flow is 0.5/0.5
WHY does it now look so bad? It was stationary before! Try dropping
down to 0.25 ml/min. Yeah... so that looks better.

Try again at 0.2 ml/min but this time flush before hand


> Try it at 900 ml/min (which is what it was in the e-room). 

> Try the Oct and see if the intensity ratio is the same here. 

> Maybe consider increasing the concentration in the tubes?

> Do we have PID measurements from before?
Yes, here: /home/rob/work/Insects/olfactoryStimuli/BubblingTest/
But without knowing whether the PID was clean, they don't count for
much.
