How to set up an air dilution with fixed flow to vacuum using an
Alicat MFC. 

e.g. say we want 1 SLPM into the system, 950 ml to vac and 50 ml to
the rest of the system. 

To calibrate the needle valve, connect as follows:

MFC -> needle valve -> strong vacuum

The flow will be choked at the needle valve and provide stable flow
upstream of the needle valve irrespective of what happens downstream. 

Set the MFC to loop pressure and use the local set point feature to
adjust pressure to 14.7 PSIA (sea level). On the main screen of the
Alicat, read off the volumetric flow rate (bottom left) and turn the
needle valve until 950 ml/min flows. Now return to volumetric flow
under non-local control (serial or analogue) and plumb in the t-piece:

MFC -> needle valve -> strong vacuum
    |
    -> rest of system


Now set MFC to 1 SLPM. 950 ml/min will go to vacuum and 50 ml/min will
go to the rest of the system. Cool, huh?





This can be confirmed with a nice alicate flow meter:

                                   A: flow meter ---> atmosphere                       
                                 /
MFC ->  -------> common port3WAY -- B: needle valve -> strong vacuum
    |
    -> rest of system
