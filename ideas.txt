Talk with Ashesh about odour delivery systems. 
- It's possible we're getting odour sucked up the output tubes. This
should be possible to stop simply by decreasing output tube diameter. 

- He thinks the valve approach at the outputs may be good but that the
valves might get crap in them over time. Using a proper MFC would help
as this would counteract this. We may be restricted to using each
valve for just one odour. 

- He suggested that the bubbling may be forming an aerosol which is
  depositing itself on the tubing. We can counteract this by either
  using glass beads or by not bubbling. It's not clear what not
  bubbling would do to the concentration. We'd need to test that. 

- He found that one key for not getting pressure transients is to keep
  flow going through valves to below 100 ml/min. 
 
- He thought that 2-way valves may be more stable and reliable than
  3-way valves. 

- In their system back in India, they use pure odour in the vials and
  inject small quantities of it into an carrier without adjusting for
  flow when this is injected. By making this dilution ratio large, the
  increase in air flow is small and so it doesn't present a problem.
